# Previewing-cpp Journey

Welcome to my personal C++ learning repository! This repository serves as a collection of files and projects that I create while learning the C++ programming language. 

## Resources

In addition to the files and projects in this repository, here are some external resources you may find helpful for learning and exploring C++ further:

- [C++ Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/): An online reference for the C++ programming language, providing detailed explanations of its features and standard library.

- [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/): A comprehensive resource for learning and understanding C++. It includes tutorials, examples, and a reference guide.

- [The C++ Programming Language](https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html): A book by Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, providing an in-depth understanding of the language.

Feel free to explore these resources to deepen your knowledge and explore additional C++ topics beyond the scope of this repository.
